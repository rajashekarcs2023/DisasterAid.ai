    "A few old friends and acquaintances reached out to congratulate me on my financial independence.",
    "</p>  <p> I think it was an honest mistake on the part of the reporter.",
    "I told her I had quit my job to write full time, and I guess she thought that meant I must have millions of dollars.",
    "</p>  <p> To be clear, I was not then, and am not now financially independent.",
    "The 100 or so people that actually know me could discern that just by seeing my kitchen.",
    "Yet perhaps 20,000 people read somewhere that I am.",
    "That means potentially 200 times more people are wrong than right on this question, because of an inference made by a reporter.",
    "</p>  <p> This scenario, in which there&#x2019;s much more wrongness going around than rightness, is probably the norm.",
    "People make bad inferences like that all day long.",
    "These wrong ideas replicate themselves whenever the person tells someone else what they know, which the internet makes easier than ever.",
    "</p>  <p> Consider the possibility that  <em> most </em>  </p>  <p> Technology may have made this state of affairs inevitable.",
    "Today, the vast majority of a person&#x2019;s worldview is assembled from second-hand sources, not from their own experience.",
    "Second-hand knowledge, from &#x201C;reliable&#x201D; sources or not, usually functions as hearsay &#x2013; if it  <em> seems </em>  </p>  <p>  <a href=\"https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/titanic-onion.jpg\">  <img src=\"https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/titanic-onion-300x297.jpg\">  </a>  <em> Standard editorial approach </em>  </p>  <p> When people go on to share what they &#x201C;know&#x201D;, there&#x2019;s usually no penalty for being wrong, but there are rewards for convincing people you&#x2019;re right: attention, money, adoration, public rhetorical victories over others, and many other things humans enjoy.",
    "</p>  <p> First-hand knowledge is a whole different thing from the second-hand kind.",
    "When you experience an event with your senses, you&#x2019;re not just accepting a verbal claim, such as &#x201C;There&#x2019;s fighting in the streets of Kabul&#x201D; &#x2014; the truth is actually happening to you.",

    "Why do we expect reporters to learn about a suddenly newsworthy situation, gather information about it under deadline, then confidently explain the subject to the rest of the nation after having known about it for all of a week?",
    "People form their entire worldviews out of this stuff.",

    "It is  <a href=\"https://www.raptitude.com/2023/05/how-to-think-about-politics-without-going-insane/\"> viscerally unpleasant </a>  </p>  <p> Aside from our own respective slivers of reliable knowledge, we mostly carry a lot of untested beliefs &#x2014; teetering piles of them, accumulated over years, from random people assuring us &#x201C;this is how it is.&#x201D; Most of these beliefs are bunk, but we don&#x2019;t know which ones.",
    "&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>  <p> Humans love beliefs, not because they&#x2019;re reliable pointers to what&#x2019;s true, but because they often feel good in some way, or have social rewards.",
    "Expressing and sharing beliefs can get us attention and social status, make us feel competent, sell our goods and services, and motivate people to do things for us, and they can just feel satisfying to say aloud.",
    "A convincing belief is simply one that feels good to the ears, or the mind.",

    "</p>  <p> Notice how many smart people believe things like, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t reason yourself out of a belief you didn&#x2019;t reason yourself into.&#x201D; This is a belief nobody would arrive at through reason.",
    "It doesn&#x2019;t stand up to even a minute&#x2019;s logical scrutiny.",
    "You certainly didn&#x2019;t reason yourself into a belief that North-Pole-dwelling elves made your childhood toys, but you probably reasoned yourself out of it.",
    "Both beliefs are just mind-candy, only for different audiences.",
    "</p>  <p> In short, human beings are bad at gathering information, inferring the right things from it, and responsibly passing it on to others.",
    "It is incredible what we&#x2019;ve achieved in spite of this &#x2014; almost entirely by carefully combining and testing our respective reliable slivers &#x2014; but as a species we remain supremely untalented at knowing what&#x2019;s true outside the range of our senses.",

    "In the rest of Crichton&#x2019;s speech, he explains why he named the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect after Murray Gell-Mann: because he&#x2019;s famous, and he&#x2019;s a physicist.",
    "People believe things named after physicists because we know they&#x2019;re smart.",
    "And Crichton is a medical doctor, so you should listen to the guy.",
    "</p>  <p> Also, none of you will be able to confirm this, but George Orwell did not say the line in the intro of this article.",
    "I just said that he did so you would take my own assertions more seriously.",
    "And it&#x2019;s too late &#x2014; you&#x2019;ve already tasted the candy.",
    "I mean, Orwell could have said something like that.",
    "He might as well have said it.",
    "He probably did, basically!",
    "I will sleep soundly anyway.",
    "There are few penalties for bullshit, and many rewards.",
    "Because nobody knows what&#x2019;s going on.",
